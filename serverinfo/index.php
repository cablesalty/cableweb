    <p>
        This site is running on a <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/">Raspberry Pi 4</a>
        with 8gb of ram enclosed in an <a href="https://argon40.com/products/argon-neo-case-for-raspberry-pi-4">Argon Neo</a>
        passive cooling case.<br>

        The site is <a href="https://www.php.net/">written in php</a> and uses <a href="https://httpd.apache.org/">Apache2</a>.<br>
        <br>
        <br>

        But the Pi also runs <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/">Home Assistant</a> to run my smart home
        (or to be more specific, smart room) alongside this site.<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        It's a pretty basic setup. Nothing too fancy.<br>
        However the server might move to a new <a href="https://react.dev/">React</a>
        frontend with a <a href="https://nodejs.org/en">nodejs</a> (<a href="https://expressjs.com/">express</a>) backend.<br>
